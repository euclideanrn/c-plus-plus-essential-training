/*
 * A reference is a type of variable that acts as an alias for another variable. When you define a reference, you are
 * giving it a different name for an already existing variable. The reference is not a separate object in memory, and it
 * does not have its own memory address. Instead, it refers to the same memory location as the variable it is
 * referencing.
 *
 * A pointer, on the other hand, is a type of variable that stores the memory address of another variable. A pointer is
 * a separate object in memory, and it has its own memory address. When you define a pointer, you are creating a new
 * variable that stores the memory address of another variable.
 *Ã¥
 * Here are some key differences between references and pointers:
 * a) A reference must be initialized when it is defined, and it cannot be changed to refer to a different object after
 *    it is initialized. A pointer, on the other hand, can be initialized later and can be made to point to different
 *    objects at different times.
 * b) A reference is automatically dereferenced when it is used, so you do not need to use the dereference operator (*)
 *    to access the value it refers to. A pointer, on the other hand, must be dereferenced using the dereference
 *    operator to access the value it points to.
 * c) A reference cannot be null, because it must always refer to a valid object. A pointer, on the other hand, can be
 *    null to indicate that it is not currently pointing to a valid object.
 *
 *
 * Pointers are variables that store the address of another variable.
 * a) the address-of operator (&) returns a pointer to the variable it is applied to.
 * b) the dereference operator (*) returns the value of the variable pointed to by the pointer.
 * c) the pointer type is the type of the variable pointed to.

     * the variable x. The address-of operator returns a pointer to the variable it is applied to.
